					<p>
					The rapid rise of computational power allows ever more capable AI agents to be trained in simulation. 
					A simulator, of course, does not fully reflect reality nor human preferences. 
					My research interests center on the grand challenge of human-centric generalization: 
					How can AI agents learn useful, human-aligned behaviors that transfer to new settings and people?
					</p>

					<p>
					I consider this question primarily in the setting of deep reinforcement learning, 
					focusing on problems arising at the intersection of generalization, human-AI coordination, and open-ended systems.
					</p>

					<p>
					I have the great fortune to be advised by Tim Rockt√§schel and Edward Grefenstette 
					and to work with other fantastic collaborators at UCL, Oxford, and FAIR.
